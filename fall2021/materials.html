<p>Labs, homeworks and projects can be found on the course calendar. The other assignments and instructions on turning them in can be found on D2L. </p>


<h3>Vitamins and Minerals</h3>
<p>To help you stay on top of lecture material, you will complete a short "vitamin" and "mineral" - mini-quizzes - along side each lecture. Vitamin and Minerals will be released on D2L on the day of the lecture.</p>
<h3>Labs</h3>
<p>Lab assignments are a required part of the course. To get credit for each lab, you must finish the entire lab and correctly turn it in.  <a href="./labhours.html"> Lab help sessions are held on Monday thru Thursday</a>. You may attend any lab help session, regardless of the section you have officially enrolled in.</p>
<h3>Homework and Projects</h3>
<p>Homework assignments are a required part of the course. Each student must submit each homework independently, but is allowed to discuss problems with other students and course staff. See the "Learning Cooperatively" section <a href="./labhours.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Data science is about analyzing real-world data sets, and so a series of projects involving real data are a required part of the course. On each project, you may work with a single partner. Both partners will receive the same score.</p>
<h3>Midterm and Final Exam</h3>
<p>These exams are a required part of the course. There will be no alternate exam. Unless you have accommodations as determined by the university and approved by the instructors, you must take the exams at the date and time provided. If you have accommodations, please provide the formal notification to your Instructor before the end of the first week of classes.</p>
