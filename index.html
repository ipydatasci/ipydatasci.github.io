    <h1>Introduction to Statistics</h1>
</h1>
  
 <p>This is the course site for MATH1401 at University of North Georgia. This course combines three perspectives:
inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. Given
data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so
as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical concepts and
skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction with
hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, document
collections, geographical data, and social networks. It delves into social
issues surrounding data analysis such as privacy and design.</p>

<p>The course is based on the <a href="http://data8.org/ ">UC Berkeley Foundations of Data Science course</a>.</p>
