  <h2>FAQ</h2>
    

    <p><strong>Q: I am not able to attend the live lecture sessions, labs, and/or discussions. Can I still take the course?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Although we encourage students to attend these live sessions, we realize that this is not always possible. A synchronous zoom session will be available for each class. You may complete the labs ahead of time remotely. If you cannot attend class but require some help with the lab, consider attending one of the many <a href="./labhours.html">lab help sessions</a>. The textbook is also a great resource, though it is not a perfect substitute for discussions, labs, live lectures, and office hours.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the best way to get help in this course?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Your best avenues are to go to office hours held by the course staff, or to ask questions on Piazza. Course staff will be monitoring Slack frequently and will try to answer your question quickly and thoroughly.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where will our grades for assignments be displayed for the course?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Grades will be displayed on D2L. </p>
<p><strong>Q: I worked with a partner on a project, and they have a grade on D2L for the project while I do not. Why is this happening?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: If this occurs please contact your instructor.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I noticed a mistake in the grading of the gradescope portion of my homework. How can I get this fixed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: To get this fixed, you must submit a regrade request via Gradescope before the regrade deadline. This is known as the regrade request window. We unfortunately will not accept any regrades after the window has closed. </p>
<p><strong>Q: I have some other grading questions. Who should I contact?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Please contact your Instructor.</p>
